# Akytos
A simple 2D game engine created with .NET 6 using OpenGL and ImGui. The design of the engine is largely based on Godot, as I felt that the Mono version of Godot barely takes advantage of the capabilities of C# and its design philosophy.

## Features (so far)
- Sprite Rendering
- Keyboard and mouse input
- Node-oriented scene architecture
    - Scriptable nodes

## Features planned for 1.0
 - Fully working editor
   - Texture importing
   - Saving and loading of scenes
   - Editor runtime
 - Spritesheets
