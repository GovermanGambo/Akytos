# Akytos
A simple 2D game engine created with .NET 6 using OpenGL and ImGui. The design of the engine is largely based on Godot, as I felt that the Mono version of Godot barely takes advantage of the capabilities of C# and its design philosophy.


## Features planned for v0.1
 - Sprite rendering [DONE]
 - Node-oriented architecture [DONE]
 - Simple editor 
   - Transformation gizmos (translation, rotation, scale)
   - Texture importing
