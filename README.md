# Akytos
A simple 2D game engine created with .NET 6 using OpenGL and ImGui. The design of the engine is largely based on Godot, as I felt that the Mono version of Godot barely takes advantage of the capabilities of C# and its design philosophy.

## Features (so far)
- Sprite Rendering
- Keyboard and mouse input
- Node-oriented scene architecture
    - Scriptable nodes

## Features planned for v0.1
 - Simple editor
   - Transformation gizmos (translation, rotation, scale)
   - Texture importing
   - Saving and loading of scenes
 - Spritesheets
